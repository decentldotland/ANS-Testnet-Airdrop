## ANS Testnet Airdrop
This airdrop represents the genesis launch (as testnet) for the [ANS protocol](https://github.com/decentldotland/ANS).

## Statistics
- snapshot blockheight: 890567
- total VID users: 527
- eligible addresses: 513
- not eligible users: 14
- ANS/VID backward compatibility: ~ 97%

## Whitelisting criterias
The ANS testnet airdrop is targeting the addresses that have claimed VID (Verto ID) on [verto.exchange](https://verto.exchange) before the airdrop snapshot.

### eligibile users
The eligibible users from thw whitelisted airdrop list are the addresses that holds a VID compatible with the [ANS label standards](https://github.com/decentldotland/ANS/#labels-string-handling) - ([label validation function](https://github.com/decentldotland/ANS/blob/main/contracts/ans.js#L533)).

VIDs with special characters (hyphen, underscore) and other De-DNS TLDs (".eth", ".bit") have been cleaned out before the validation process to increase the percentage of the backward compatibility.

### benefits
eligibile-airdropped address preserve the ownership of its testnet ANS label on the mainnet launch.

## Note
This is a ***testnet*** contract, the implementation of PoR and the existing of testnet $DLT are both for experimental purpose.
